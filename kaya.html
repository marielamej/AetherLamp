        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This section outlines the design and development process for the ceramic components of the Aether Lamp from Kaya's perspective. The goal of this project was to create an elegant ceramic base that supports the lamp's light control system while providing an organic and tactile aesthetic.</p>

        <!-- Research Section -->
        <section class="research">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>In this phase, Kaya explored various ceramic techniques, materials, and forms. She researched the balance between aesthetics and functionality, ensuring the lamp base would be both beautiful and stable. The research also involved exploring the role of ceramics in lighting design and tactile interaction with objects.</p>

        <section class="design-iterations">
            <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
            <p>Kaya went through several design phases, from initial sketches to 3D models, refining the form and structure to suit the lamp's functionality. Below are some images showing the design process from early sketches to refined models.</p>

        <!-- Technical Process Section -->
        <section class="technical-process">
            <h2>Technical Process</h2>
            <p>Kaya used traditional ceramic techniques such as wheel throwing, molding, and glazing. The lamp base was made from stoneware to ensure durability and a pleasant tactile experience. She also explored firing techniques to achieve the desired finish and ensure the baseâ€™s compatibility with the electrical components of the lamp.</p>

        <!-- Final Outcome Section -->
        <section class="final-outcome">
            <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
            <p>The final ceramic base was a seamless blend of form and function. It provided stability for the lamp while maintaining an elegant and minimalist look. The textural finish, created through glazing and firing, enhances the tactile quality of the lamp and complements the light emitted by the system.</p>
